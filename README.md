Baby Safe â€“ Inexpensive System Project
Abstract
The Baby Safe Project focuses on enhancing child safety in vehicles. It features a Baby Safe Tag, Key Fob, and a smartphone application, designed to alert parents if a child is left in a vehicle under high-temperature conditions or if the child is out of the parent's proximity.

Introduction
In response to the increasing incidents of children being unintentionally left in vehicles, the Baby Safe project aims to develop an autonomous device that ensures a child's safety through proximity and temperature alerts.

Project Design
The system consists of:

Baby Safe Tag: Attached to the child, monitors temperature and proximity.
Key Fob: Carried by parents, communicates with the Baby Safe Tag.
Smartphone Application: Provides real-time alerts and monitoring.
Progress Overview
Development of the initial prototype and software.
Implementation of temperature and Bluetooth-based alarms.
Integration of sleep mode for energy efficiency.
Ongoing testing and refinement of the system.
Future Plans
Transition to Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) for a more stable platform.
Enhanced testing in various real-world scenarios.
Development of a user-friendly mobile application compatible with Android and iOS.
Final system integration and testing.
